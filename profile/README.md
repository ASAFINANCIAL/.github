Asa bridges the gap between fintech and banking by building a new set of rails that enables partnership at scale. Asa fintechs don't compete, they don't offer checking accounts, cards, or loans, but instead, they partner with a local institution who provides all of the banking products and services they need. Asa's new set of rails allows fintechs to go to market at unlimited scale with local financial institutions.
